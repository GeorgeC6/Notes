# Chapter 10: Dynamic Loads


## 10.1 Introduction

The loads change sharply with time, and the velocity of the member changes obviously (there exists inertia force in the member).

Experiments proved that Hooke's law applied validly under static loads can be applied to the cases under dynamic loads.

- **Dynamic load coefficient**

$$
K_d = \frac{\text{Dynamic response}}{\text{Static response}} = \frac{\sigma_d}{\sigma_{st}}
$$

Classification of dynamic loads:

1. Simple dynamic stress: the acceleration can be determined: “method of kinetostatic（动静法）”
2. Impact load
3. Alternating load
4. Vibration

## 10.2 Method of Kineto-Statics

- D'Alembert's principle
    - Primary force system + Inertia force system = Equilibrium force system

## 10.4 Stresses & Deformations Under Impact Loads
